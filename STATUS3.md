### Tasks Accomplished
#### Algorithm Implementation and Testing
Finished design, still completing implementation and testing of algorithm
#### Communicating with Database
We completed the fetch API in Javascript (for post method) so we can send the data from the frontend to backend and communicate with MongoDB. We are still working on fixing certain bugs with this process. Additionally, we added functionality to send back the updated state from the backend to the frontend. 
#### Added Questions
We have many questions now!

### Future Tasks
#### Heat Map
We are trying to add google maps API and use the weights for the objects in out algoritm to generate a heat map to show where the user is most likely from 
#### How to Get Data
We still need to get more data to test and "train" (in a way) the algorithm
