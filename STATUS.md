# STATUS REPORT

## Week of Sunday, April 7, 2019

### Tasks Accomplished
#### Algorithm Design
We worked on the algorithm that will calculate the state a user is from for each given question
#### Sending data back and forth to database
We set up a Javascript post API fetch which allows us to communicate between front end and back end to send all the data we need to MongoDB. We are still working through a few bugs and investigating the use of body parser for this purpose
#### More questions!
We added more questions

### Future Tasks
#### Continue Working on Algorithm
We need to keep testing our algorithm to try and get it as accurate as possible
#### Getting Data?
We might put our quiz in the Tufts Facebook groups to get a ton of test data :)
